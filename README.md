This is a tool to record messages sent and received by the YouTube Iframe Player API.

The goal of this is to develop an understanding of how the API works and to help with reverse engineering to create a custom implementation.

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider
